title: Release Notes of node-mongo-tenant
description: >
  The mongo tenant is a highly configurable mongoose plugin solving multi-tenancy problems on
  document level (for now...). It creates a tenant-reference field and takes care of unique indexes.
  Also it provides access to tenant-bound model-classes, that prohibit the exploid of the given tenant scope.
  Last but not least the "MAGIC" can be disabled so that shipping of the same code in single- and
  multi-tenancy environment (on premise vs. cloud hosted) is a question of a single line of config.

releases:
- version: Unreleased
  added:
    - >
      Plugin can now be applied multiple times on single schema to achieve multi dimensional setups.

      To achieve this a new config option named `dimension` is available. This is the prime indicator for compatibility
      between two different plugin instances. That option is optional with `tenant` as default so backward compatibility
      is guaranteed.
    - 'Full support of path level index options (`new Schema({t: {type: String, index: {...}})`).'
  changed:
    - >
      **BREAKING** Default value of option to make tenant id required is now `true` instead of `false`. This changes the
      default behaviour.
  removed:
    - >
      **BREAKING** Schemas, Models and Documents no longer expose `hasTenantContext` to indicate if the plugin is
      applied to them.
    - >
      **BREAKING** Schema types no longer support the shorthand `partialFilterExpression` option. That shorthand option
      was never supported by mongoose in the first place. If that option is needed please use
      `{..., index: { partialFilterExpression: ...}}` instead.
- version: 1.6.0
  date: 2019-03-21
  fixed:
  - Missing tenant context in populated subdocuments ([#16](https://github.com/craftup/node-mongo-tenant/issues/16)).
  changed:
  - Models with tenant context (`Model.byTenant(...)`) will have a modified db connection object
    returning Models bound to same context.
  - Public schema reference of plugin instances became unenumerable.
    This is necessary to avoid inifinite loops in case two tenant aware schemas are used in a discriminator setup.
- version: 1.5.0
  date: 2018-07-06
  fixed:
  - Fix discriminator handling, properly preserve tenant scope. ([#38](https://github.com/craftup/node-mongo-tenant/issues/38))
