title: Release Notes of node-mongo-tenant
description: >
  The mongo tenant is a highly configurable mongoose plugin solving multi-tenancy problems on
  document level (for now...). It creates a tenant-reference field and takes care of unique indexes.
  Also it provides access to tenant-bound model-classes, that prohibit the exploid of the given tenant scope.
  Last but not least the "MAGIC" can be disabled so that shipping of the same code in single- and
  multi-tenancy environment (on premis vs. cloud hosted) is a question of a single line of config.
